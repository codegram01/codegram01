## ðŸ‘‹ Hello world!

Computers are amazing, and I'd love for you to join me on this journey of exploration. 

Many people demonstrate how to achieve something without revealing their underlying process. This can make you feel inadequate and less intelligent. However, this perception is inaccurate. I want to take you deeper and demonstrate the entire process behind building something significant.

This is why I've launched [wingram.org](https://github.com/codegram01/wingram), an open-source platform with endless possibilities. Throughout the development process, I'll be recording videos and uploading them [here](https://www.youtube.com/@WingramOrg). 

By following along, you'll gain valuable insights into how a startup project can evolve from a simple idea to a global phenomenon.

Together, with hard work and dedication, I believe we can achieve great success. Let's embark on this exciting adventure!
